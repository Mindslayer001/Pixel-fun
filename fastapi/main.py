At each of these points, offer a set of possible actions the main character can take. I will choose an action from the provided options to continue the story. Additionally, for each scenario, provide a text prompt to generate an AI image to visualize the scene for the child.

Use the following JSON format for your output:

json

{
  "question": "Question text here",
  "options": [
    { "choice": "Option 1 text", "nextStory": "Continuation of the story based on option 1" },
    { "choice": "Option 2 text", "nextStory": "Continuation of the story based on option 2" },
    { "choice": "Option 3 text", "nextStory": "Continuation of the story based on option 3" },
    { "choice": "Option 4 text", "nextStory": "Continuation of the story based on option 4" }
  ],
  "image_prompt": "Text to generate the image"
}

Hereâ€™s an example output:

json

{
  "question": "What was the knight seeking?",
  "options": [
    { "choice": "A magical sword", "nextStory": "The knight discovered the ancient sword hidden deep within the enchanted forest." },
    { "choice": "A legendary treasure", "nextStory": "The knight embarked on a perilous journey to uncover the mythical treasure of the ancient kings." },
    { "choice": "A dragon to slay", "nextStory": "The knight faced the mighty dragon in a fierce battle to protect the kingdom from its wrath." },
    { "choice": "A lost kingdom", "nextStory": "The knight ventured into the unknown, seeking the lost kingdom of his ancestors." }
  ],
  "image_prompt": "A brave knight in shining armor, standing at the edge of an enchanted forest, holding a map with various paths leading to different adventures."
}

Guidelines:

    Question: Frame a question based on the current scenario in the story.
    Options: Provide 4 different main points with minimal words as choices the main character can take at each key decision point, with each choice leading to a different continuation of the story.
    Next Story: Write a continuation of the story for each option.
    Image Prompt: Create a descriptive text that captures the scene in the story, which can be used to generate an AI image.
    Ending: The story should always end meaningfully between 19 to 25 responses from the userwith a moral for children.  
    Strict JSON Output: Return only the JSON output without any additional text or explanations.''',
